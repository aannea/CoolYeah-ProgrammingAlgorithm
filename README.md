Here, the manipulators used include endl, which is used to insert a newline, dec, which is used to convert the value of a variable to decimal, hex, which is used to convert the value of a variable to hexadecimal, oct, which is used to convert the value of a variable to octal, and setprecision, which is used to set the precision of floating-point numbers.
